I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (CSAIL) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Prof. Nicholas Roy](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/nicholas-roy/). I am very grateful for the support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/).

My research is motivated by a dream experiment I hope to try someday: let a robot run unattended for a long while (~years) with an algorithm that learns the world's structure, so we can peek inside the robot's head *to see how complicated everyday life is.*  We've yet to see robots capable of that experiment, though.  My work draws upon ideas from many areas, including task and motion planning (TAMP) and algorithmic statistics, to design learning algorithms and reasoning systems necessary for robots to complete such an arduous task.

Previously, I completed a joint concentration in mathematics and computer science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) and was advised by [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Prof. Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). I was also a research intern at [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/). 

When I'm not working on research, you can find me running (not so quickly) and occasionally bike touring. I am also an observant Jew, which may affect my availability online ([is it a Jewish holiday today?](https://isitajewishholidaytoday.com/)).
