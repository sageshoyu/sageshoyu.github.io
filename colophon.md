title: Colophon

The design of this webpage is heavily inspired by the webpages of [Derek Kedziora](https://derekkedziora.com/) (who made the [template](https://demo.derekkedziora.com/) from which this website was created) and [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/). The color palette is Steph Ango's [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), created to look like pigmented ink on a digital screen. 

The typography of this site implements (albeit imperfectly) the key lessons of [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) by Matthew Butterick. The header font is [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/), designed by Mike Abbink of Bold Monday. The body font should be [Lora](https://www.cyreal.org/fonts/lora/) of type foundry [Cyreal](https://www.cyreal.org/). The fonts are hosted directly on the site.

This page is built by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and served from a domain hosted by [CSAIL](https://tig.csail.mit.edu/web-services/github-pages/).
