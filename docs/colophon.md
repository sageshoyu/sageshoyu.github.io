# Colophon

Typically, in a colophon (usually appears in printed media) you'd get a brief synopsis of the design of the artifact. The purpose of this page is _slightly_ different (I'm not a typography history buff) -- it's to fill in any details about how to design a similar site that may be hard to get from reading the <a href="https://github.com/sageshoyu/sageshoyu.github.io">code</a> directly.

The headings and menu text are set in <a href='https://www.ibm.com/plex/'>IBM Plex Sans</a>, which was designed by Mike Abbink in collaboration with Bold Monday. 
The body text is set in <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html">Bitstream Charter</a>, which was designed by Matthew Carter in 1987.

The design of this site is based on <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">mdo</a> and built by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. 
Many of the adjustments to the original website template come directly from Matthew Butterick's <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a> (highly recommend!). 

This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and served by <a href="https://tig.csail.mit.edu/web-services/hosting-options/github-pages/">CSAIL at MIT</a>.
