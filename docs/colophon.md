The headings and menu text are set in <a href='https://www.ibm.com/plex/'>IBM Plex Sans</a>, which was designed by Mike Abbink in collaboration with Bold Monday. 
The body text is set in <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html">Bitstream Charter</a>, which was designed by Matthew Carter in 1987.

While the aesthetics of this site is largely inspired by <a href="https://stephango.com/about">this blog site by kepano</a> (indeed, we use their color scheme  <a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki">Flexoki</a>), the actual design is based on <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">mdo</a>. 
The code was derived from <a href="https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole">Dark-Poole</a> (had more up-to-date documentation at the time of writing) and built by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. 
Many of the adjustments to the original website template come directly from Matthew Butterick's <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a> (definitely worth a read!). 

This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and served by <a href="https://tig.csail.mit.edu/web-services/hosting-options/github-pages/">CSAIL at MIT</a>.
