title: A Blog? 
---

Hello! Welcome to the new blog section of my website. 
This is a place for ramblings, odd-thoughts, rants, and other odd pieces
of information as I make my way through grad school. 
I added some nice Ghibli banners to counterbalance the chaos.

To be frank, the blog is still under construction. There are lots of things to add --
a commenting mechanism, MathJax... all that good stuff. Except I accidentally pushed the branch... and 
now it's too late.

To set some expectations: I won't be posting very frequently - probably when
the spirit of the Aibishter moves me. 

See you all for the first (official) post (probably when I'm actually done putting the blog infrastructure together)! 
Not sure what it's going to be yet, and it will probably be... fine.
