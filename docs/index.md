I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (CSAIL) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Prof. Nicholas Roy](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/nicholas-roy/). I am very grateful for the support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/).


My research interests include theory and algorithms that engage with the interaction of computational systems and the physical world. 
I focus on robot decision-making in partially-observable and noisy environments. 
In the past, I was interested in applying ideas from differential geometry and dynamical systems to allow robots to learn safely. 

I completed a joint concentration in mathematics and computer science from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) and was advised by [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Prof. Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). I was also a research intern at [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/). 
I am an observant Jew, which may affect my availability online ([is it a Jewish holiday today?](https://isitajewishholidaytoday.com/)).
